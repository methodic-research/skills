  Use this skill when you are an agent executing a Chronicle task: a discrete,
  steered unit of work launched from the Tasks surface with context such as an
  experiment, dataset, or asset auto-injected. The launch environment carries
  the task id via AGENT_TASK_ID or the session asset id; the requested work
  comes from the task steer. Example requests: "work on this task", "do the
  task", "generate a dataset for this experiment and register it", or "gather
  and summarize this experiment's results". This generic skill owns task
  mechanics only: discover injected context, do the steered work with existing
  Chronicle skills, and record outputs back to the task. It is not for creating
  or launching tasks.

# Execute a task

Drive one Chronicle **task** to its result. A task is a generic, steerable
`agent_session` (`session_mode = task`) for a unit of work that isn't an
experiment's main research loop — prepping a dataset, summarizing an
experiment's results, a one-off analysis. The end state is: the steered work
done, and every asset you produced **linked back to the task** (its provenance)
and wired to its experiment where the steer implies it.

**This skill owns three mechanics only — the *what* is your steer:**

1. **Read your injected context.** Don't ask the user what experiment/dataset
   you're working with — it was auto-injected when the task launched. Resolve it:

   ```
   chronicle.get_task(task_id)        # task_id from your launch env (AGENT_TASK_ID)
   → { title, inputs: [{target_type: "experiment"|"asset", target_id}], outputs: [...] }
   ```

   Then ground on each input — `chronicle.get_experiment` / `chronicle.search`
   (scoped to the experiment) for an `experiment` ref; the asset read / `load`
   tools for an `asset` (a dataset, a report) ref. Your scoped key can read
   exactly this context and no more — that *is* the boundary.

2. **Do the steered work**, composing the purpose-built skills rather than
   reimplementing them:
   - generate / register a dataset → **chronicle-register-dataset** (by-reference
     + metadata) or **chronicle-dataset** (byte upload);
   - write a summary / takeaways → **chronicle-write-report**;
   - anything else the steer asks — you have the full methodic skill set.

3. **Document your outputs** (the one thing that must not be implicit). After
   creating an asset:

   ```
   chronicle.link_task_output(task_id, asset_id)     # provenance: this task made it
   ```

   and, when the steer ties it to an experiment, **also** wire it there — the two
   links are independent:

   ```
   chronicle.link_asset(experiment_id, asset_id, link="input"|"output")
   ```

## The two canonical shapes

**"Generate a dataset for experiment X."** `get_task` → an `experiment` input
(X). Build/locate the dataset bytes; register it (chronicle-register-dataset);
`link_task_output(task, dataset)`; then `link_asset(X, dataset, "input")` — the
dataset X *consumes* (task output → experiment input, the design's "bridge").

**"Summarize experiment X's results."** `get_task` → an `experiment` input (X).
Read X's runs/reports/outputs (`chronicle.search` + `chronicle.get_experiment` +
`chronicle.list_outputs`); write the summary (chronicle-write-report);
`link_task_output(task, report)`. The summary is the task's output, surfaced on
X via the task↔experiment association.

## After the task

Tell the user:
1. The task title + the assets produced (with their ids).
2. For each, where it's linked — to the task (always) and to an experiment
   (when applicable), so the provenance is legible.
3. Anything the steer asked for that you could **not** do within your injected
   read-scope (you can't reach experiments/assets outside your `task_inputs`).

## Failure modes

- **No task id in env** — you're not in a task session, or the launcher didn't
  set `AGENT_TASK_ID`. Ask the caller for the task id rather than guessing; don't
  fabricate one.
- **Context ref unreadable** — your scoped key only reaches your `task_inputs`.
  A 403/empty on something outside them is expected; surface it, don't try to
  widen scope.
- **`link_task_output` refused (not Administer)** — your task key lacks
  `Administer` on the task; surface the error (don't silently skip recording the
  output — the provenance matters).
- **Asset created but un-linked** — never leave a produced asset only in your
  conversation: a task's outputs must be `link_task_output`'d so they show on the
  task and on the asset's "produced by task" line.

## Requires

- `chronicle.get_task` + `chronicle.link_task_output` (the task MCP surface).
- The sibling skills it composes: `chronicle-register-dataset`,
  `chronicle-dataset`, `chronicle-write-report`, and `chronicle.link_asset` /
  `chronicle.get_experiment` / `chronicle.search` / `chronicle.list_outputs`.
